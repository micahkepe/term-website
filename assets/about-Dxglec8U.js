pursue a Minor in Data Science to complement my studies. Since I was a child,
I have been captivated by puzzles and solving problems, and the world of
computer science offers a vast amount of novel solutions for the problems of
today and the future.

create significant and meaningful contributions that address the ever-growing
issues in our interconnected world. With a relentless drive to continually
push my boundaries, I am confident in my ability to make a positive impact.

Throughout my academic journey, I am excited about establishing connections
with industry professionals, fellow students, and potential mentors. I
believe that by engaging in thought-provoking discussions and exchanging ideas
, we can collectively explore opportunities within the realms of computer
science and data science. I am eager to participate in internships, research
collaborations, and networking opportunities that will further enrich my
skills and allow me to contribute to impactful projects.
