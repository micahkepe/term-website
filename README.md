**term-website** is a highly configurable, client-side terminal emulator for
the browser. Designed as a fun and experimental project, it emulates a shell
environment with a mock backend. It's perfect as a starting template for a
terminal-style portfolio or even as a standalone terminal emulator.

> Have fun exploring! There are plenty of easter eggs hidden inside. ðŸŽ‰

## **What is term-website?**

**term-website** is a **TypeScript-powered browser terminal** built with
vanilla TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. It uses [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/) for
terminal emulation and a mock backend to simulate a shell environment.

Core features include:

- **Filetree navigation** with commands like `ls`, `cd`, and `cat`.
- Configurable commands, themes, and shortcuts.
- **Stateless operation**: Refreshing resets the terminal to its initial state.

---

## **Features**

- **Interactive Shell-Like Environment**: Commands like `ls`, `cd`, `cat`, and
  `open` simulate real terminal behavior.
- **Configurable Themes and Filetree**: Customize the look and content via
  `config.json` and `/files/`.
- **Built-In Shortcuts**: Navigate, edit commands, and interact with ease.
- **Stateless Design**: Starts fresh on every reload for simplicity.
- **Easter Eggs**: A sprinkle of surprises for curious users.

## **Configuration**

### **Customizing Filetree**

Modify the `/src/server/file-system/files/` directory to add, remove, or edit
files visible in the terminal.

### **Adding Commands**

Add new commands by creating files in the `/src/server/commands/` directory.
Commands must implement the `Command` interface and the `execute` method.

### **Theming**

Update the default theme in `config.json`. Available themes include:

- `dracula`
- `catpuccin-mocha`
- `solarized-dark`
- `kanagawa`

To add a new theme, implement the `ITheme` interface in
`src/client/terminal/themes.ts`.

### **Shortcuts**

The following shortcuts are supported:

| Shortcut            | Description                   |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `Ctrl + L`          | Clear the terminal            |
| `Ctrl + C`          | Cancel the current command    |
| `Ctrl + W`          | Delete the last word          |
| `Ctrl + U`          | Delete the current line       |
| `ArrowUp/ArrowDown` | Cycle through command history |

## **Documentation**

Full documentation is autogenerated via `tsdoc`. To generate it:

```bash
npm run doc
```

Open `docs/index.html` in a browser to explore.

## **Roadmap**

Planned features:

- **TAB Autocomplete**: Autocomplete file names and commands.
- **Markdown Rendering**: Render Markdown files directly in the terminal.
- **Enhanced Command History**: Navigate multi-line commands seamlessly.
